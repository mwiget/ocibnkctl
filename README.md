Single-binary CLI that deploys F5 BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes (BNK) 2.3.0
on a two-node [k3s](https://k3s.io/) cluster — one combined
control-plane + worker (server), one worker (agent) dedicated to TMM
running in demo mode (virtio inside the pod netns; no DPU, no SR-IOV, no
Multus). The k3s nodes run directly as containers on the host OCI
runtime (docker or podman) — **no kind, no k3d, no third-party
orchestrator binary**.

Aimed at low-spec corporate laptops where dpubnkctl's bare-metal +
DPU pipeline is overkill. Same poc.yaml-driven, resume-safe shape;
much shorter pipeline.

## What this tool does

Drives a BNK deployment in three phases:

1. **cluster up** — start the k3s server + agent containers and join
   them, install Calico (acts as a simulator for larger SR-IOV
   deployments) in place of k3s's bundled flannel, label the worker for
   TMM, fetch kubeconfig.
2. **deploy prereqs** — namespaces, FAR pull secret, cert-manager.
3. **deploy flo + cne** — FLO from the release-manifest chart at
   `repo.f5.com`, License CR with the operator's JWT, CNEInstance with
   `advanced.demoMode.enabled: true` and TMM pinned via `nodeSelector:
   app=f5-tmm`.

Symmetric **`destroy`** unwinds it: bnk-forge unregister → remove the
k3s node containers → remove the cluster's docker network.

## Pinned versions

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| BNK | 2.3.0 |
| CNE release manifest | 2.3.0-3.2598.3-0.0.170 |
| Kubernetes (k3s node image) | 1.30.8 (`rancher/k3s:v1.30.8-k3s1`) |
| Calico | v3.28.2 |
| cert-manager | v1.16.2 |
| FLO chart | resolved at deploy time from the release manifest |

## Minimum host resources

|                          | Cluster floor       | With bnk-forge      | Free disk |
|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Linux (host docker)      | **12 cores · 24 GB**| **14 cores · 26 GB**| **~10 GB**|
| macOS / Windows Docker Desktop | **12 CPUs · 24 GB allocated to the VM** | **14 CPUs · 26 GB** | **~10 GB** |

(Configured in Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources. Rancher Desktop /
Colima use the same numbers — same underlying Linux VM model.)

### Why so much for a "demo"

TMM is pinned to the agent node via `nodeSelector: app=f5-tmm`. Unlike
kind, **k3s leaves the server node schedulable** (no control-plane
`NoSchedule` taint), so the remaining BNK pods spread across both nodes
rather than all piling onto one worker. The Kubernetes scheduler admits
pods against their `requests`, not their actual RSS, and the chart
reserves heavily:

> The per-pod values below are the BNK chart's request reservations
> (backend-independent), tabulated as a single-worker total. On the kind
> predecessor the tainted control-plane forced the whole stack onto one
> worker. On k3s the server node is schedulable, so the non-TMM load
> spreads across both nodes — measured ~13 pods on the server / ~7 on the
> agent in the validated run — easing per-node pressure. The host floor
> still applies, since one docker daemon backs both node containers.

| Pod (on the worker)                 | Memory request | CPU request |
|---|---|---|
| f5-tmm                              | 9204 Mi        | 4100m       |
| f5-cne-controller (4 containers)    | 1600 Mi        | 1080m       |
| f5-downloader                       | 1000 Mi        | 500m        |
| f5-spk-csrc                         | 1024 Mi        | 500m        |
| f5-crdconversion                    | 1024 Mi        | 500m        |
| f5-dssm-db / -sentinel              | 1152 Mi each   | 600m each   |
| f5-observer / -receiver             | 500 Mi each    | 512m / 1c   |
| f5-observer-operator                | 256 Mi         | 250m        |
| f5-spk-cwc                          | 640 Mi         | 556m        |
| f5-afm                              | 512 Mi         | 500m        |
| f5-ipam-ctlr / f5-rabbit            | 512 Mi each    | 100m / 300m |
| otel-collector / flo                | 256 Mi each    | 500m / 250m |
| **Sum on the worker**               | **~20 Gi**     | **~12 cores**|

Each k3s node container reports the docker daemon's full memory and
CPU as its allocatable — there is no partitioning. So the cluster won't
schedule the full stack until the daemon (or Docker Desktop VM) is
sized above the request total, plus headroom for the control-plane pods
and kernel overhead in both node containers.

### What the cluster actually uses

Steady-state, after `CNEInstance.Available=True`, the cluster's real
RSS is much smaller than the reservation:

| Component                        | Working set    | CPU       |
|---|---|---|
| TMM pod (worker)                 | ~1.2 GB        | ~100m     |
| kube-apiserver                   | ~900 MB        | ~150m     |
| All other F5 pods (~20)          | ~1.0 GB        | ~470m     |
| Calico + coredns + etcd + kube-* | ~700 MB        | ~150m     |
| Kernel / runtime per node        | ~500 MB × 2    | —         |
| **Total cluster RSS**            | **~4.5 GB pod + ~1 GB overhead** | **~900m steady, ~1.2c during TMM init** |

So the cluster lives inside ~6 GB of real memory once it's up — it
just won't *get there* without first satisfying the K8s scheduler's
~20 Gi worker reservation.

### Symptom when the floor is too low

`ocibnkctl e2e` reaches `[5/5] deploy-cne` and stalls. Six pods
(`f5-dssm-db-0`, `f5-dssm-sentinel-0`, `f5-spk-cwc-*`,
`f5-observer-{0,receiver-0,operator-*}`) sit `Pending` with
`FailedScheduling: Insufficient memory`, and
`CNEInstance.Available` never goes true. Quick check (nodes are
`k3s-<poc>-server-0` / `k3s-<poc>-agent-0`):

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig <poc>/artifacts/kubeconfig describe node k3s-<poc>-agent-0 \
  | grep -E "Allocatable:|Allocated resources:" -A6
```

If `memory Requests` is ≥99% of `Allocatable`, raise the docker
daemon allocation and re-run from the failed phase (`ocibnkctl
deploy cne …`) — it's idempotent.

### Disk

~0.3 GB (`rancher/k3s` image) + ~2.4 GB (F5 container images pulled to
the worker) + ~0.5 GB (cert-manager, alpine/k8s tooling, manifests) +
~5 GB headroom for k3s cluster state and logs.

`ocibnkctl doctor` reports the host's actual CPU count and fails
when it falls below `MinBaseline`. Override the constants in
`internal/version/version.go` if you've tuned chart values to reduce
requests.

## bnk-forge integration

If a local [bnk-forge](https://github.com/sp-prod-field/bnk-forge)
clone exists at `~/git/bnk-forge` (or `$OCIBNKCTL_BNK_FORGE_PATH`)
when `ocibnkctl init` runs, the new PoC's `bnk_forge:` block is
pre-filled and enabled. On `cluster up`, ocibnkctl best-effort
registers the k3s cluster with bnk-forge — if the local bnk-forge
stack isn't running, the auto-hook logs a clean skip and continues.

**`ocibnkctl` never installs or starts bnk-forge for you.** If it's
configured but not running, bring it up manually (`cd ~/git/bnk-forge
&& make deploy`) then `ocibnkctl bnk-forge launch` to register
after the fact.

## Download

Prebuilt binaries for each tagged release are on the
[**GitHub Releases page**](https://github.com/mwiget/ocibnkctl/releases/latest) —
three archives per release plus a `checksums.txt`:

| Platform | Archive |
|---|---|
| Linux (Intel/AMD) | `ocibnkctl_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz` |
| Linux (ARM64) | `ocibnkctl_<version>_linux_arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `ocibnkctl_<version>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz` |

One-liner install (Linux amd64; swap the suffix for your platform):

```bash
VERSION=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/mwiget/ocibnkctl/releases/latest | sed -n 's/.*"tag_name": *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/mwiget/ocibnkctl/releases/download/${VERSION}/ocibnkctl_${VERSION#v}_linux_amd64.tar.gz" \
  | tar -xz -C /tmp ocibnkctl
sudo install -m 0755 /tmp/ocibnkctl /usr/local/bin/ocibnkctl
ocibnkctl version
```

Releases follow `v<bnk-version>-<n>` — e.g. `v2.3.0-1`, `v2.3.0-2`.
The `2.3.0` prefix tracks the pinned BNK release; the `-n` suffix
increments per ocibnkctl-only iteration.

Or build from source — see [Repo layout](#repo-layout-the-binary-itself)
below.

## Requirements

| Tool | Why |
|---|---|
| **Docker** or **Podman** | runs the k3s nodes as containers; FLO + cert-gen also shell into an `alpine/k8s:1.31.5` container at deploy time. No separate cluster tool — the k3s nodes are launched via the runtime directly |
| **kubectl** | cluster reads/writes (apply, wait, label) |
| **helm** | cert-manager + FLO install, release-manifest pull |
| **git** *(optional)* | `init` git-inits the PoC repo (skippable with `--no-git`) |

Verify after install:

```bash
ocibnkctl doctor
```

`doctor` checks each tool (docker/podman, kubectl, helm) and the host
resource floor. For any that's **missing**, it prints a ready-to-run,
OS/arch-aware install command (and a docs link) right under the failed
check — so you can copy-paste the fix, or have an agent offer to run it.

What customers supply themselves, dropped into `keys/` of the PoC repo
(delivered through F5's normal channels):

- FAR tarball — image-pull credentials for `repo.f5.com`
- JWT — TEEM activation token

## Cluster backend (native k3s)

ocibnkctl ships a single backend: the k3s nodes (`rancher/k3s:v1.30.8-k3s1`)
run directly as containers on the host OCI runtime, driven through the
docker/podman CLI — there is **no third-party orchestrator binary** to
install. `cluster up` starts a server (combined control-plane + worker)
and an agent (the TMM worker), joins them over a per-cluster docker
bridge network, remounts each node's rootfs `rshared` (so Calico's
`mount-bpffs` init works), then layers Calico on top of k3s with its
bundled flannel/traefik/servicelb disabled. The result is the same
two-node, Calico-CNI, k8s-v1.30.8 shape the deploy pipeline expects.

Podman works through the same code path — set `cluster.provider: podman`
in `poc.yaml` (or let `doctor`/`cluster up` auto-detect the runtime).

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Create a fresh PoC repo. Auto-detects ~/git/bnk-forge.
ocibnkctl init demo --customer "Acme"
cd demo

# 2. Drop the operator-supplied files into keys/.
cp /path/to/f5-far-auth-key.tgz keys/
cp /path/to/license.jwt          keys/.jwt

# 3. Confirm poc.yaml is clean.
ocibnkctl validate

# 4. Run the pipeline (~10–20 min with a warm docker cache).
ocibnkctl e2e --yolo --confirm-cluster demo

# 5. Tear down (symmetric):
ocibnkctl destroy --yolo --confirm-cluster demo
```

## Per-phase invocation

If you'd rather drive the phases one at a time for diagnostics:

```bash
ocibnkctl cluster up      --yolo --confirm-cluster demo
ocibnkctl deploy prereqs  --yolo --confirm-deploy  demo
ocibnkctl deploy flo      --yolo --confirm-deploy  demo
ocibnkctl deploy cne      --yolo --confirm-deploy  demo
```

Every phase is idempotent and gated by `--yolo` plus a typo-guard.

## Agentic workflow

You can drive a PoC conversationally with an AI coding agent instead of
typing the commands yourself — useful for getting your feet wet with BNK,
or for letting an agent deploy, inspect, and troubleshoot the cluster and
bnk-forge on your behalf.

Every PoC created by `ocibnkctl init` ships an **`AGENTS.md`** — an
operator + agent guide covering the pipeline, the `--yolo`/`--confirm-*`
safety gates, cluster inspection, the scenario workflow, bnk-forge, and
guardrails (read `poc.yaml` first, prefer `ocibnkctl` subcommands over
ad-hoc kubectl, confirm scope before destructive actions, treat `keys/`
as secret). A one-line **`CLAUDE.md`** `@`-includes it for Claude Code.

ocibnkctl does **not** embed an LLM — you bring your own agent and model
endpoint. The `agent` subcommand just prints the ready-to-paste
invocation for your preferred CLI, each pointed at the PoC's `AGENTS.md`:

```bash
ocibnkctl agent                 # list supported CLIs
ocibnkctl agent claude --poc ./demo   # print the invocation for Claude Code
```

```text
# Claude Code (https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code)
cd ./demo && \
  claude
# Then say:
#   "Read AGENTS.md, then walk me through deploying BNK on this PoC
#    (validate -> cluster up -> deploy), explaining each phase as you go."
```

Supported out of the box: `claude`, `gemini`, `aider`, `openai`,
`pi`, `opencode`. Set a custom model endpoint with `--llm-endpoint`
(or the CLI's own `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_API_BASE`). The agent
runs the same gated `ocibnkctl` subcommands you would — nothing
bypasses the `--confirm-*` typo-guards.

### The `AGENTS.md` guide

This is the operator + agent guide shipped verbatim into every PoC
(source: [`internal/embedded/files/AGENTS.md`](internal/embedded/files/AGENTS.md)
— edit it there, not here):

<details>
<summary>📖 <strong>AGENTS.md — ocibnkctl PoC operator + agent guide</strong></summary>

> You are driving a **PoC repo** created by `ocibnkctl init`. This file is
> your operating manual; `CLAUDE.md` in this directory simply `@`-includes
> it. Read `poc.yaml` first — it is the single source of truth for this
> deployment. Everything below is how to act on it safely.

#### What this PoC deploys

F5 BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes (BNK) 2.3.0 on a **two-node k3s cluster**:
one combined control-plane + worker (server) and one worker (agent)
dedicated to TMM. The k3s nodes run directly as containers on the host
OCI runtime (docker or podman) — there is **no kind, no k3d, no
third-party orchestrator binary**. TMM runs in **demo mode** (virtio
inside the pod netns); no DPU, no SR-IOV, no Multus on the base cluster.

#### Prerequisites (verify with `ocibnkctl doctor`)

- a container runtime: **docker or podman**
- **kubectl** and **helm** on PATH
- ~12 cores / ~24 GB free for the full BNK stack (see `doctor`)

No cluster tool to install — the k3s nodes are launched via the runtime
directly.

#### Customer-supplied secrets — required before any deploy

Drop these into `keys/` (gitignored) before running a deploy phase:

- `keys/f5-far-auth-key.tgz` — FAR image-pull credentials for repo.f5.com
- `keys/.jwt` — TEEM activation token

Both come from F5's normal license-portal channels. **Never commit them,
never echo their contents, never paste them into a chat or a report.**

#### The pipeline

```
validate  →  cluster up  →  deploy prereqs  →  deploy flo  →  deploy cne
```

Each phase is idempotent and resume-safe. Run them individually, or
chain all five with one command:

```
ocibnkctl e2e --yolo --confirm-cluster <poc-name>
```

A full run takes ~10–20 min on a laptop with a warm image cache. Per-phase:

```
ocibnkctl validate
ocibnkctl cluster up     --yolo --confirm-cluster <poc-name>
ocibnkctl deploy prereqs --yolo --confirm-deploy <poc-name>
ocibnkctl deploy flo     --yolo --confirm-deploy <poc-name>
ocibnkctl deploy cne     --yolo --confirm-deploy <poc-name>
```

**Safety gates (do not bypass without the operator's say-so).** Every
mutating phase requires **two** flags: `--yolo` (acknowledges the action
is destructive) and `--confirm-cluster <name>` (cluster mutations) **or**
`--confirm-deploy <name>` (in-cluster mutations) — the value must echo
`poc.yaml.metadata.name`, a typo-guard against acting on the wrong PoC.
`destroy` runs the pipeline in reverse (bnk-forge unregister → remove k3s
node containers + network).

#### PoC layout

```
poc.yaml         source of truth — tear-down + redeploy read only this
AGENTS.md        this guide          CLAUDE.md  @AGENTS.md include
journal/         append-only markdown log written during runs
artifacts/       rendered k3s.yaml, kubeconfig (0600), helm values, certs
keys/            gitignored — FAR tgz + JWT live here
```

Inspect the running cluster with the fetched kubeconfig (PoC-scoped — it
is **not** merged into `~/.kube/config`):

```
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/artifacts/kubeconfig
kubectl get nodes          # k3s-<name>-server-0, k3s-<name>-agent-0
kubectl get pods -A
```

#### Scenarios

After a successful deploy, exercise BNK features. Each scenario maps to
an F5 how-to article, renders manifests, applies them, asserts state,
and writes a JSON+md report under `reports/<timestamp>/`.

```
ocibnkctl scenario list            # names + ratings (green/amber/red)
ocibnkctl scenario run --all       # all green scenarios
ocibnkctl scenario run <name>      # one scenario
ocibnkctl scenario clean <name>    # delete what a scenario applied
```

Ratings: **green** = fully testable in this demo shape; **amber** =
control-plane verifies but data-plane plumbing is partially missing;
**red** = needs DPUs / real upstream BIG-IP (never executed here). Many
scenarios depend on `bgp-peer-frr`, which installs Multus + an FRR BGP
peer on demand (the base cluster has no Multus).

#### bnk-forge (optional)

If `~/git/bnk-forge` (or `$OCIBNKCTL_BNK_FORGE_PATH`) exists when
`ocibnkctl init` runs, the `bnk_forge:` block is pre-filled and
`cluster up` best-effort registers the cluster with bnk-forge. If the
local stack isn't running, registration is skipped — deployment never
blocks on it. `ocibnkctl` will not install or start bnk-forge.

```
ocibnkctl bnk-forge launch       # ensure bnk-forge sees this cluster
ocibnkctl bnk-forge unregister   # remove it
```

#### How to act as an agent here

- **Read `poc.yaml` and the latest `journal/` entry first** to learn the
  current state before proposing any action.
- **Prefer `ocibnkctl` subcommands over ad-hoc kubectl/helm/docker.** The
  CLI is idempotent and journals what it does; raw commands drift from
  the source of truth. Before writing a new script for something, check
  whether a subcommand or flag already does it (`ocibnkctl --help`,
  `<cmd> --help`).
- **Confirm scope before destructive actions** and never invent or
  auto-fill the `--confirm-*` gate without the operator agreeing.
- **Treat `keys/` as secret.** Never read, print, commit, or transmit its
  contents. Reports are scrubbed of secrets before sharing.
- **Surface failures honestly** — if a phase fails, show the real output
  and the failing step; don't paper over it.
- When stuck, `ocibnkctl doctor` and the per-phase logs under
  `artifacts/` are the fastest way to see what the environment actually
  reports.
- **If `doctor` reports a missing host tool** (docker/podman, kubectl,
  helm) it prints a ready-to-run, OS-aware install command. Offer to run
  it for the operator — but confirm first, since installing host tools is
  a system change.

```

The cluster kubeconfig lands at `artifacts/kubeconfig` (mode 0600) and is
**PoC-scoped — never merged into `~/.kube/config`**, so it can't clobber
your existing contexts. To poke around the cluster yourself:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/artifacts/kubeconfig   # from inside the PoC dir
kubectl get nodes        # k3s-<name>-server-0, k3s-<name>-agent-0
```

(`ocibnkctl` itself drives `kubectl`/`helm` by passing this path via the
`KUBECONFIG` env, so it never touches your global config either. `destroy`
removes the file.)

## Network topology

The shape after a full `e2e` plus `bgp-peer-frr` (everything the
other scenarios build on) — the substance here (Calico, the Multus
NAD bridge, ZeBOS/BGP) is backend-agnostic. One docker bridge on the
host (the k3s cluster's own, `k3s-<poc>`); two k3s node containers
(`k3s-<poc>-server-0` = control-plane + worker, `k3s-<poc>-agent-0` =
TMM worker); a Multus-managed Linux bridge inside the worker carries
BGP traffic between TMM and the FRR helper pod. Scenario backends are
plain Calico pods — the Gateway IPs they serve get plumbed via BGP, so
the backends don't need to be on the NAD themselves. (Illustrative node
names below are shortened for the diagram.)

  TMM ZeBOS advertises (redistribute kernel, at router-bgp scope —
  silently dropped if placed inside address-family ipv4):
    192.168.99.0/24      (net1 connected)
    203.0.113.100/32     Gateway scn-gateway        (http-routing-e2e)
    203.0.113.101/32     Gateway scn-extres-gw      (external-resource-pool)
    203.0.113.102/32     Gateway scn-proxy-gw       (proxy-protocol-l4)

  FRR installs each /32 as a kernel route:
    203.0.113.100/32 via 192.168.99.X dev net1 proto bgp
  so any client in the FRR pod can curl the Gateway addresses
  end-to-end via the NAD bridge, completely bypassing TMM's eth0
  TCP hook. This is what http-routing-e2e and external-resource-pool
  rely on for their data-plane assertions.
```

Key knob: `CNEInstance.spec.advanced.tmm.env TMM_MAPRES_ADDL_VETHS_ON_DP=FALSE`
is set by `bgp-peer-frr`. With this `TRUE` (TMM's default for
demoMode), `mapres` grabs `net1` for the userspace data plane and
flushes its kernel IP — ZeBOS then has nothing to source-bind
to. Flipping it `FALSE` lets `net1` stay a normal Linux interface
with its NAD-assigned IP so the kernel TCP stack handles BGP
traffic ordinarily.

## Scenarios — testing F5 how-tos against the running cluster

After `e2e` brings the cluster up, drive named test scenarios against
it. Each scenario maps to one F5 how-to article (or sub-article) and
exercises a slice of BNK functionality end-to-end: render manifests
into `artifacts/scenarios/<name>/`, apply them, assert reconciled
state, write a JSON+md report under `reports/<timestamp>/scenarios/`.

> **Validated on native k3s.** A clean run — fresh cluster → `e2e`
> deploy → `scenario run --all` — passes **12/12 green, 0 failed** on the
> k3s backend (measured 2026-06-04, full parity with the kind
> predecessor). The ratings below hold as measured; the wall times are
> indicative — the authoritative current timings are in the checked-in
> [reference report](#reference-run-report). Getting there took four
> k3s-specific fixes (a `standard` StorageClass, a `/var/run`→`/run`
> symlink for Multus netns, host-side `docker cp` of the bridge CNI, and
> arch-aware plugin selection) — all in `cluster up` / the scenarios now.

```bash
ocibnkctl scenario list                            # all known scenarios + rating
ocibnkctl scenario run http-routing --poc ./demo   # apply + verify + report
ocibnkctl scenario run http-routing --dry-run      # render manifests only
ocibnkctl scenario clean http-routing              # delete what was applied
```

Rating is a stable hint about what's testable in the 2-node / demo-TMM
shape:

| Rating | Meaning |
|---|---|
| green | fully testable here |
| amber | partially testable — control-plane verifies, data-plane plumbing missing |
| red   | requires real DPUs / BGP peers / etc.; listed for discoverability, never executed |

Plus four scenarios drawn from the BNK Use-Cases / CRD pages rather

| [Dynamic IP address allocation (FIC for Gateway API)](https://clouddocs.f5.com/bigip-next-for-kubernetes/latest/use-cases/bnk-ficforgatewayapi.html) | 🟡 | [`fic-dynamic-ip`](internal/scenarios/ficdynamicip) |

| gRPC routing ([`GRPCRoute`](https://clouddocs.f5.com/bigip-next-for-kubernetes/latest/custom-resource-definitions/bnk-gateway-api-grpcroute.html), grpcbin backend, grpcurl client) | 🟡 | [`grpc-loadbalance`](internal/scenarios/grpcroute) |

`fic-dynamic-ip` (🟡): manifest-side configuration applies cleanly
(F5BnkGateway, Gateway w/ infrastructure.parametersRef, HTTPRoute)
but Gateway never reaches Programmed=True. f5-cne-controller logs
"No IPAM found for Gateway" — the F5BnkGateway pool isn't auto-
converted into IPAM/IPAMRange CRs in this BNK 2.3.0 demo
deployment. The scenario asserts the control-plane state and
surfaces the AddressNotAssigned condition as informational.

`grpc-loadbalance` (🟡): GRPCRoute reconciles, Gateway reaches
Programmed=True, BGP route propagates, grpcurl installs SHA-
verified, and a direct grpcurl-to-backend Service call lists
all gRPC services successfully. But cleartext gRPC traffic
through the Gateway returns RST_STREAM(INTERNAL_ERROR) — TMM's
standard HTTP/json/httprouter profile chain (visible in audit
logs) breaks gRPC framing. Investigation confirmed TMM
unconditionally applies `profile-http` + `profile-json` +
`profile-httprouter` to all listener types (HTTP and HTTPS),
corrupting HTTP/2 binary frames regardless of TLS termination.
Setting `appProtocol: kubernetes.io/h2c` on the Service, switching
to an HTTPS listener on port 443 with TLS, and adding `profile-sbi`
(all verified via TMM audit logs) did not change the outcome. This
is a BNK 2.3.0 FLO limitation. Fix needs either a "raw HTTP/2
passthrough" mode for GRPCRoute listeners, or a BNK profile
override path not yet exposed through the Gateway API CRDs.

Wall times measured on a fresh `e2e` (cluster destroy + redeploy)
running 2026-05-21 on a Linux laptop. The two TMM-restarting
scenarios (`bgp-peer-frr` + `core-file-collection`) dominate at
~3 minutes each; the others are tens of seconds because they
either don't touch TMM or piggyback on the bridge already up.
`ocibnkctl scenario run --all` runs every green-rated scenario
in topo-sorted dependency order, writing an aggregate
`reports/<stamp>/run.{json,md}` summary alongside the per-scenario
JSONs.

Cluster bring-up itself (`ocibnkctl e2e`) is **~5m10s**:
validate 0s · cluster-up 31s · deploy-prereqs 20s · deploy-flo
23s · deploy-cne 3m56s (includes waiting on `bnk-gatewayclass`
to reach `Accepted=True` — required to keep first-run scenario
Gateways from being marked-for-deletion by the controller).

How-tos **#5** ([DOCA Offloads on DPU](https://clouddocs.f5.com/bigip-next-for-kubernetes/latest/how-tos/traffic-offload.html)),
**#11** ([Static Active-Standby Interface Bonding](https://clouddocs.f5.com/bigip-next-for-kubernetes/latest/how-tos/configure-static-active-standby-bonding.html)),
and **#12** ([TMOS DNS Service Integration with CIS](https://clouddocs.f5.com/bigip-next-for-kubernetes/latest/how-tos/configure-tmos-dns-service-integration-with-container-ingress-services.html))
are omitted from the table because they require resources this
shape can't provide: DPU silicon (#5), bondable physical NICs (#11),
and a real upstream BIG-IP GTM box (#12). They remain valid BNK
features outside the ocibnkctl shape.

Ratings are assigned only after a scenario is built and run.
Implemented scenarios that pan out land as 🟢; ones that
hit a real architectural barrier on k3s+demoMode get 🟡
with the gap documented in the scenario's `Description()`.
Empty cell = scenario not yet built.

`bgp-peer-frr` (green) deploys a real BGP session between an FRR
pod and TMM's ZeBOS daemon, peered over a Multus
NetworkAttachmentDefinition (bridge CNI) on a per-node Linux
bridge. The NAD path bypasses TMM's eth0 TCP hook entirely —
BGP rides net1 in both pods, exchanging prefixes via the bridge.
Six assertions pass: Multus DaemonSet Ready, both pods have net1
in the 192.168.99.0/24 NAD range, ZeBOS sees the neighbor, BGP
session Established, and FRR's BGP table has at least one prefix
learned from TMM (via `redistribute kernel`).

`http-routing-e2e` (green) — depends on `bgp-peer-frr` for the
NAD plumbing. Applies a GatewayClass + Gateway (static
spec.addresses=203.0.113.100) + HTTPRoute + nginx backend.
TMM's ZeBOS (via `redistribute kernel`) advertises 203.0.113.100/32
into BGP; FRR installs the kernel route via net1; the verify
step execs 5 curls from inside the FRR pod, which already has
the route. All 6 assertions pass including the 5×curl. Path:
FRR socket → FRR kernel route → net1 → bnk-bgp bridge → TMM net1
→ Gateway listener → nginx. TMM's eth0 TCP hook is completely
bypassed.

Reproduce manually:

```bash
kubectl -n scn-bgp exec deploy/scn-frr -c frr -- \
  curl -sS -H 'Host: ocibnkctl.local' http://203.0.113.100/
# → ocibnkctl-scenario-httproute-e2e-OK
```

`external-resource-pool` (green) — demonstrates how-to #10 (load
balance to non-Service backends) via the BNK `Pool` CR. HTTPRoute
`backendRefs` points at a `Pool {group:k8s.f5net.com, kind:Pool}`
instead of a Service; `Pool.spec.members` lists endpoints by
IP+port. In this shape, the "external" backend is an nginx pod attached
to the bnk-bgp NAD (same bridge TMM uses), with its NAD IP
auto-discovered and rendered into the Pool CR. Gateway address
is 203.0.113.101 to avoid collision with `http-routing-e2e`.

`cwc-admin-access` (green) — implements how-to #1 (restrict access
to sensitive data). Demonstrates BNK's dual-gate access control
on the CWC admin API: mTLS at the TLS layer + bearer token at
the HTTP layer. Both materials are produced by the deploy-flo
phase already (cwc-license-client-certs Secret + cwc-auth-token
Secret in f5-cne-core); the scenario just replicates them into
its own namespace, spawns a curl probe pod, and runs three
requests against https://f5-spk-cwc.f5-cne-core.svc:38081/status:
authenticated (expect 200 + license JSON), no Authorization
header (expect 401 "invalid token format"), bogus token
(expect 401 "invalid token"). Independent of bgp-peer-frr —
this is a pure runtime-access check.

`proxy-protocol-l4` (green) — implements how-to #9 (PROXY-protocol
iRule on an L4 route). The new BNK CRs reconcile (`F5BigCneIrule`
Programmed, `L4Route` Accepted, `BNKNetPolicy` ResolvedRefs True),
TMM proxies the TCP traffic, FRR learns the Gateway IP via BGP,
and 5/5 curls from FRR through the Gateway return the marker body
with the parsed `proxy_addr` set to FRR's NAD IP — proving the
iRule's `TCP::respond` prepended the PROXY v1 line before nginx
saw the request. Load-bearing knob: `L4Route.spec.pvaAccelerationMode:
disabled`, which keeps the data path in TMM's TCL slow path. With
the default `full/assisted` PVA mode, TMM hardware-offloads the
connection after handshake and `TCP::respond` fires in the VM but
can't reach the offloaded wire — symptoms are 200 OK from nginx
turning into "broken header" errors and curl `(52) Empty reply`.

`core-file-collection` (green) — implements how-to #4 (set up
core file collection). One-line CNEInstance.spec.coreCollection.
enabled=true flip plus `advanced.coremon.hostPath=true` so the
CoreMond DaemonSet survives the single-node-RWO storage class.
FLO auto-creates a CoreMond CR + DaemonSet in f5-cne-core and
adds kernel-cores / f5-core-store / tmm-core volumes to the TMM
Deployment template. The scenario asserts the CR exists, the
DaemonSet is Running, and the CNEInstance condition
`CoremondAvailable=True`. The how-to's "kill -11 to force a
crash" verification step is intentionally NOT automated —
crashing TMM mid-scenario destabilises the cluster, and the
follow-up "did a core file land in /var/crash" check needs a
privileged node-level read we'd rather not bake in. Operators
can run the kill manually after the scenario and inspect the
k3s worker container's filesystem to confirm capture.

## Reference run report

A complete `e2e --with-scenarios` report from a clean cluster
is checked in at
[`examples/reports/run-lab-2026-06-04T16-45-09Z.md`](examples/reports/run-lab-2026-06-04T16-45-09Z.md)
so a reader can see the full report shape (versions, host
resources, cluster topology, F5 control-plane pods, every deploy
phase, and every scenario row) without running anything locally.

(the one amber scenario — `fic-dynamic-ip` — is skipped by
`--all` and must be run explicitly).

## Testing

```bash
make test    # Go unit tests (poc, deploy, cluster, scenarios)
make smoke   # unit tests + Layer A CLI smoke (no cluster required, ~5s)
```

`make smoke` is the gate to run before pushing — it covers the
non-cluster-dependent surface area in one shot.

## Design references

- **[dpubnkctl](https://github.com/mwiget/dpubnkctl)** — the
  bare-metal + DPU sister tool. ocibnkctl is a copy-fork:
  `internal/poc`, `internal/cluster`, `internal/cli` are rewritten
  for the k3s path; `internal/bnkforge`, `internal/deploy` are
  forked verbatim with minor adjustments (local kubectl/helm
  instead of containerized).
- **[f5-bnk-udf](https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-bnk-udf/tree/v2.2.0)**
  (branch `v2.2.0`) — the inspiration for the BNK-on-host shape:
  `advanced.demoMode.enabled: true` + node label + nodeSelector,
  ZeBOS dynamic-routing ConfigMap pattern, multi-worker
  topology. Same CNEInstance recipe family; ocibnkctl adapts it
  to a two-node k3s cluster with Multus NADs replacing the
  macvlan-on-bare-metal approach used in f5-bnk-udf.
